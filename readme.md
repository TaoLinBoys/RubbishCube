Rubiks Cube:

5/12/2016- Started work on cube.
Thought about potential data structures to store cubies

5/13/2016- Settled on a 3d array structure.
6 by 3 by 3 array to hold cubies.
Created constructor for the cube. 
Started work on front rotation

5/17/2016- Began work on processing.
Made 2d tiles in processing to resemble cube faces.

5/18/2016- Made rotations work.
Switched to making 3d cubies in processing. Scrapped previous processing work.

5/19/2016- Discovered conceptual error with rotations.
All rotates fundamentally broken.

5/22/2016- Complete cube model created in processing.


5/23/2016- Made front rotate work (for demo)
Began fixing other rotations

5/24/2016- Demo version of cube.
Began work on saving cube progress in files.

5/25/2016- Fixed merge errors.
Fixed back rotation.

5/26/2016- Fixed all rotations.
Adjusted colors of cube to identify with the original cube.
Created buttons for each rotation.
Started thinking about rubiks cube solving algorithm.

5/27/2016- Created buttons so that it rotates the closestface. They are not working.
