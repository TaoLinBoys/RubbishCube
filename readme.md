Rubiks Cube:

5/12/2016- Started work on cube.
Thought about potential data structures to store cubies

5/13/2016- Settled on a 3d array structure.
6 by 3 by 3 array to hold cubies.
Created constructor for the cube. 
Started work on front rotation

5/17/2016- Began work on processing.
Made 2d tiles in processing to resemble cube faces.

5/18/2016- Made rotations work.
Switched to making 3d cubies in processing. Scrapped previous processing work.

5/19/2016- Discovered conceptual error with rotations.
All rotates fundamentally broken.

5/22/2016- Complete cube model created in processing.


5/23/2016- Made front rotate work (for demo)
Began fixing other rotations

5/24/2016- Demo version of cube.
Began work on saving cube progress in files.

5/25/2016- Fixed merge errors.
Fixed back rotation.
3D cube now follows the color designation from the Cube class.

5/26/2016- Fixed all rotations.
Adjusted colors of cube to identify with the original cube.
Created buttons for each rotation.
Started thinking about rubiks cube solving algorithm.

5/27/2016- Created buttons so that it rotates the closestface. Started tests to see how to rotate closest face.
Created a scramble function and button.
Working on display of solution.

5/31/2016- Created an effect that highlights the closest face/the face the two buttons at the bottom of the screen will rotate.

6/3/2016- Deleted the buttons that manually rotated each face. Created a reset button. Made the the rotation by closest face work better by changing some numbers.

6/5/2016- Created a button to show the solution in a string of text

6/6/2016- Created labels on each face of the cube
Fixed a rotate bug on the "DOWN" face
Labeled buttons and changed button colors
Changed solving function to only display next move of solution instead of whole string.
Solve function will now track your moves and dynamically adjust the solution accordingly.
